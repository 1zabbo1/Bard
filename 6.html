      <p>You are stranded on a deserted island in the Caribbean. The only clue to your rescue is a tattered map of the island, with a note that says "Captain Blackbeard's treasure is hidden somewhere on this island."

You decide to follow the map and search for the treasure. As you explore the island, you encounter a variety of challenges, including dangerous traps, wild animals, and even Captain Blackbeard's ghost!

To play, simply type commands into the text box below. For example, to move north, you would type "go north". To examine an object, you would type "examine object".

You can also type "help" to get a list of all the available commands.</p>

    // This is a simple JavaScript event listener that will listen for keypress events on the input field.
    document.getElementById("input-field").addEventListener("keypress", function(event) {
      // If the player presses enter, we will process their input.
      if (event.keyCode === 13) {
        // Get the player's input.
        var input = document.getElementById("input-field").value;

        document.getElementById("input-field").value = "";

        // Process the player's input.
        // This is where you would add your game logic.
        // For example, you could check if the player's input is a valid command, and then update the game state accordingly.

        // Once you have processed the player's input, you should update the game text.
        updateGameText("You typed: " + input);
